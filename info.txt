// BANK ACCOUNT

// Start by creating the object and the properties. You can leave the functions empty for now if you want.
// You'll find all the information about what properties the object should have in the readme file.

// In the deposit and withdrawal function use this code to show the prompt

// You need to change the message of course. You should also do some research why parseFloat() is used here
// answer by making a comment in the code.
// Be aware of that you need to add some code to this so you can display the actual input.

// In the deposit and withdrawal function you also need to handle som potential errors.
// To handle one of the potential error you can use this piece of code
//isNaN(variableName);
// you need to change the variableName to your actual variable.
// you also need to check some other conditions here and use a logical operator.
// try to say the sentece out loud or think it:
// "A user should not be able to put 0 or negative numbers or empty string or a type that is not a number"
// Do you know what operator you should use?

// In the accountError and accountExit function you can use this to show a message to the user:
//alert("your code here and maybe properties");
// of course you need to put a proper message and you might need to display some of the properties.

// STARTER FUNCTION
//function atm() {
//let choice = parseInt(prompt("Display menu choices here"));
//prompt user for choice.

// you can use the variable choice for your switch or if/else statement
// so choice will hold the value of the user input.
// deposit button event handler
